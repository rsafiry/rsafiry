### Hi there 👋

My name is Ryan, I'm a 4th year student at [Columbia College, Columbia University](https://www.college.columbia.edu/) studying economics. In 2022, I interned at J.P. Morgan, and the year before that, I was at the U.S. Senate. I am also a researcher at Columbia, having worked with several professors on a multitude of projects.

My background is in computational finance, econometrics, economic development, legal systems, and moral philosophy.
